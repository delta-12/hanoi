Objective: Move all disks from the left most rod to the right most rod.

The rules are simple...

1. Only one disk may be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

There are three rods.  The game begins with all disks stacked in descending order on the left most rod.  To move a disk from one rod to another, enter the number of the rod the disk is currently on, followed by a SPACE, then number of the rod you wish to move the disk to, and then ENTER.

For example...

To move the top disk from the left most rod to the middle rod the input is as follows:
1 SPACE 2 ENTER

Best of luck!
